# Project Euler solutions in Nim Language

This repo use for learning Nim by solve Project Euler math problems.

I used to program in python before so I take python solution from [nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/page/project-euler-solutions).

PR is welcome, you can solve it in Nim or look at python for reference
